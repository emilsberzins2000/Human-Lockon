# GTA-Style AI Lock-On Camera (Real-Time Human Tracking)

🎯 **Real-time AI camera system with GTA-style lock-on mechanics**

This project implements a **fast, responsive lock-on camera** inspired by GTA missile targeting systems.  
It detects humans in real time, locks onto the chest area, zooms dynamically, snaps the camera instantly, and plays a synthesized lock-on sound — all without using any external audio files.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Real-time human detection** (YOLOv8)
- 🎯 **Chest-based targeting** (more realistic aiming)
- ⚡ **Instant snap camera movement** (very fast lock)
- 🔴 **Lock indicator**
  - Yellow = locking
  - Red = fully locked
- 🔊 **Synthesized lock-on sound**
  - Frequency ramps from **600 Hz → 1000 Hz**
  - Stays at **static 1000 Hz** when fully locked
- 🔍 **Adaptive zoom**
  - Target far → zoom in
  - Target close → zoom out
- 🖥 **Fullscreen support**
  - Press **F** to toggle fullscreen
  - Press **ESC** to exit fullscreen
- 🎮 **GTA-like feel**, built fully in Python
